# MakePsmGreatAgain

Modifications to the PSM Developer applications

# v1.0 -
Automatically creates publishing license (if not allready created) and PSM Dev bootup (still need psm+ for development!)  
Re-Enable's SceUsbSerial for ALL applications (yes, if u want to use it on your own homebrew, YOU CAN!)  
Spoofs SecureTick to allways be within the valid period for the PsmDrmBoot and KConsole Cache (no need to "Refresh PSM+ License")
